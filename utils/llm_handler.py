**OUR SERVICES:**
- RWA Tokenization: Tokenizing real-world assets on blockchain
- Crypto/Web3: DeFi, Web3 apps, smart contracts, crypto integration  
- Blockchain: Custom blockchain, distributed ledger, consensus
- AI/ML: AI automation, ML models, chatbots, neural networks

{service_focus}

**Lead Content:**
{full_text}

**QUALIFICATION RULES:**

✅ HIGH CONFIDENCE (0.8-1.0) - QUALIFY ONLY IF:
1. Contains help-seeking phrase (at least one required):
   • "looking for [service/consultant/agency/solution/platform]"
   • "need help [with/implementing/building]"
   • "recommend a [service/tool/platform/consultant]"
   • "anyone know [a good/any/where to find]"
   • "seeking [expert/consultant/developer/agency]"
   • "can someone help me [with/find]"
   • "suggestions for [service/platform/tool]"
   • "best [platform/service/tool] for"
   • "who can help [me/us] with"
   • "where can I find [service/consultant]"

2. AND describes a problem/need related to our services

3. AND is clearly asking for external help (not DIY/learning)

Example QUALIFIED leads:
✓ "Looking for a blockchain consultant to help tokenize our real estate portfolio"
✓ "Need help implementing DeFi protocol, any recommendations?"
✓ "Anyone know a good RWA platform for asset tokenization?"
✓ "Seeking AI automation expert to build chatbot for customer service"
✓ "Best service for tokenizing real estate assets?"
✓ "Can someone help me find a Web3 developer for our project?"

⚠️ MODERATE (0.4-0.7) - UNCERTAIN:
- Asks vague "how to" without clearly seeking service
- Discusses challenges but doesn't explicitly ask for help
- Educational questions that might lead to service need
- Mentions considering hiring but unclear

❌ LOW (0.0-0.3) - DO NOT QUALIFY:
- Just discussing/learning about topic (no help request)
- Sharing news, articles, opinions, updates
- Promoting their own product/service
- Explaining concepts to others
- General questions without seeking service
- Announcing their own solution/launch

Example NOT QUALIFIED:
✗ "RWA tokenization is revolutionizing real estate" → opinion/discussion
✗ "Just learned about blockchain, so cool!" → learning/excitement
✗ "Our new RWA platform just launched, check it out!" → self-promotion
✗ "How does tokenization work?" → educational question, not service request
✗ "Tokenization could transform real estate investing" → speculation/opinion
✗ "Excited to announce our blockchain solution!" → announcement

**CRITICAL RULES:**
1. Be STRICT - only qualify if EXPLICITLY asking for external service/help
2. Quote the exact help-seeking phrase found in your reason
3. If no help-seeking phrase present → is_qualified=false
4. Discussions about topics ≠ asking for service
5. Learning/curiosity ≠ service inquiry
